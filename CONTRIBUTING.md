NOTE: before filing any new bug reports or pull requests, you *must* read the official contribution rules posted [here](https://sevenbits.github.io/tools/bugs/report-mlul):

https://sevenbits.github.io/tools/bugs/report-mlul

Bug reports or pull requests that do not follow these policies and rules will be **rejected**.

PULL REQUESTS

I will accept pull requests on two conditions:

1. Your code follows my coding styles (mentioned above) and
2. Your code is licensed under an LGPL-compatible license and is readable and decently commented.

Assuming that your code is in compliance with these rules, I usually will accept pull requests that either: add a feature/fix a bug that is listed via the checkboxes above or fix an issue filed through GitHub.
